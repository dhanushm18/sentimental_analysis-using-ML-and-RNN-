# Sentimental Analysis using ML and RNN

This project explores sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. We leverage both traditional machine learning (ML) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis has various applications, including:

* **Customer feedback analysis:** Understanding customer opinions about products or services.
* **Social media monitoring:** Tracking public sentiment towards brands or topics.
* **Market research:** Identifying trends and opinions in the market.

This project aims to provide a comparative analysis of ML and RNN models for sentiment classification.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Libraries:**
    * `scikit-learn`: For traditional machine learning models.
    * `TensorFlow` or `Keras`: For RNN implementation.
    * `NLTK` or `spaCy`: For text preprocessing.
    * `Pandas`: For data manipulation.
* **Dataset:** \[*Specify the dataset used, e.g., IMDb reviews dataset, Sentiment140 dataset, etc.*]

## Models Implemented

* **Machine Learning Models:**
    * \[*List the ML models used, e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression.*]
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**
    * \[*Specify the RNN architectures, e.g., Simple RNN, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).*]
